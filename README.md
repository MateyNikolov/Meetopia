# Meetopia

This is a social media app made with React for the React Final Exam in SoftUni.

The app has Public and Private Part.

The Public Part is Catalogue/Feed, visible without authentication so the user can scroll and see all of the shared topics.

The App has a Login and Register functionality and Age Validation.

In the Private Part the user can share their own Thoughts/Posts with Pictures and also make the whole CRUD Operations- Create, Edit, Delete.

The HTML and CSS Part is written by me, without using any extern Librarys or Packages.

For the Pictures i am using external API - Cloudinary.

Every user has his own Profile Page and can upload a Profile Picture.

Every Post has Likes and Comments section.

For Back End im using the SoftUni Practice Server.

Please consider that this project is made only for educational purpose.
